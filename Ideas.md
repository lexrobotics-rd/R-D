R&D Ideas
=========

Any ideas that don't have any actual code yet.



RoboPython
----------
Everyone hates RobotC. Why don't we write an interpreter from an abstracted, reasonable language down to RobotC code?



Minibots
--------
Okay, so FIRST says the robot cannot drop off parts of itself.
Why don't we have a 9V battery on a protoboard on a minibot which is connected to the main robot via STRING?
XD it'll be awesome. And FRC has a very similar subchallenge.



Walking/Hopping
---------------
After PIDSwegWay works, we can work on walking.
Another direction would be a single hopping "leg" with cable "muscles" attached to winding-up motors, 
or a set of huge ratcheted springs that would fling the entire robot into the air and crunch back down, 
absorbing most of the load and getting ratcheted the rest of the way with a motor.



Ultrasonic Mapping
------------------
The ultrasonic sensor is fiendishly inaccurate, but if we rotate and swivel it around enough, and with 
enough of the sensors, we can map out the region around us in real time.



Pathfinding
-----------
See main lexrobotics repo.



FLYING ROBOT
------------
'nuff said
