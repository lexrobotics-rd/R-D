A Bit of Git: LexRobotics R&D Git Guide 2014-2015
=================================================

Welcome to the LexRobotics (eventually) comprehensive guide to Git! This guide 
serves as a reference for aspiring and advanced Git users alike. If you are new 
to programming or have never even heard of Git, this document will take you 
through all the steps needed to become a master Gitter.

What is Git?
------------

Git is a distributed revision control system: it is a program that allows many 
software developers to work on a given project without having to share a common 
network. Git automatically tracks changes to code files and other documents, 
and it allows developers to compare, restore, and in some cases merge the 
various revisions of a file. Git is most frequently accessed via a Command Line 
Environment (CLI), or by entering text into a terminal emulator (for Macs, this 
is Terminal.app). Don't worry if you don't understand all the new programming 
terminology -- it will get more familiar to you as you use it!

One of the major benefits of Git is its ubiquity. Git comes preinstalled on all 
Mac and Linux computers, and a simple installation file is available on 
Windows.

Windows Installation Guide
