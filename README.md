LexRobotics R&D Repository
==========================

Hi!
---

Hello! You're now in the "Research and Development" ~~code~~ highly purified 
epicness repository used by the R&D division, where we "research and develop" 
(whatever that means) stuff not strictly associated with the robotics team. 
Some things you might do in R&D could be Science Fair-related, or could simply 
be any engineering-related project you want to do on the side. Either way, here 
you can find people interested in similar things who can learn with you, and 
help develop everyone's ideas to come up with new and amazing things.

A lot of the stuff may actually extremely relevant to the robotics team, 
and will quite possibly end up being used for the competition! However, 
R&D will retain everything as a separate copy, even between years, as an 
inspiration for more and more ideas.

Before we begin, though, here are some guidelines for the use of the Git repository.

Guidelines
----------

Git reference sheets are available, so ask us about it!

Naturally, you should be nice about how you use Git, and not reset other people's 
changes, etc. Also, don't edit this file.

Additionally, there is a very simple header-comment format to help people 
understand what you're doing (or _trying_ to do). While it's often arduous 
to update, it'll really, really help people understand what you're trying to do.

At the top of each file, you need something like this:

```
/*
[file name]
[one-line explanation of what it does]

LastUpdatedOn: [date]
LastUpdatedBy: [name]
Status: [status - final scrim copy, compiles but untested, just started, etc.]
*/


/* HOW TO USE IT
[instructions on all functions, etc.]

[any other notes: bugs, caveats, dependencies, etc. that might be good to know]
*/

//Code starts here.
```

See any files in the repo for examples.

:P

Other than that, **happy hacking**!
