Mecanum.c
A testfile for developing Mecanum drive capabilities.

LastUpdatedOn: 1/20
LastUpdatedBy: Clive
Status: Added "encoders" for fwd/side/rot, and outputs it. Haven't tried compiling. And also added thresholding for rotation to avoid drift.
Todo: Separate into a Mecanum.h file (function mecanumJoystickControl)? Get TranslateRotate for Autonomous to work.

TIP: when operating the ROBOTC FTC control thing, and the joystick input just doesn't work,
try pressing All Stopped, then Teleop Ready and Teleop Running again, and it will work.
("If you believe in magic, you might just be coding in ROBOTC")
