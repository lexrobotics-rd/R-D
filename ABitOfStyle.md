A Bit of Style: LexRobotics R&D Style Guide 2014-2015
=====================================================

Folder Structure
----------------

Store all programming files in `C:/Users/[username]/Documents/Programming/`.  
Use the subdirectory `R-D` for R&D projects and ideas that are in-progress.  
Use the subdirectory `Test` for temporary files.

Filenames
---------

File and directory names should be written in PascalCase.  
Executible files (i.e. including a `task main()`) should have a `.c` file 
extension.  
Included libraries (i.e. meant to help a `.c` file do things) should have a 
`.h` file extension.

```cpp
#include "Lib\LibraryOfAlexandria.h"
```

Header
------

At the top of each file, leave a header block comment:

```cpp
/*
[file name]
[one-line explanation of what it does]

LastUpdatedOn: [date]
LastUpdatedBy: [name]
Status: [final scrim copy, compiles but untested, just started, etc.]
*/

/*
HOW TO USE IT
[instructions on all functions, etc.]

OTHER NOTES
[bugs, caveats, dependencies, etc. that might be good to know]
*/

//Code starts here.
```

Comments
--------

Other than the header comment, you should also try to insert comments to 
explain each function as well as any complicated or unusual parts of the code 
that requires explanation.  
Comments in `C`-based languages (ROBOT-C, C++, etc.) start with `//` and last 
until the end of the line.  
Multi-line comments in `C`-based languages start with `/*` and end with `*/`. 
They cannot be nested.  
The best code, though, doesn't need comments for documentation; the program 
is so well outlined that it is self-explanatory.

```cpp
void getDistance(int x1, int x2, int y1, int y2) {
    //Finds the Euclidean distance between two specified points.
    /*
    This text is ignored by the compiler.
        /*
        As is this text.
        */
    This line is no longer a comment, and will produce an error!
    */
}
```

Variables
---------

For normal variables, use camelCase.  
For constants, use capital letters and underscores instead.

```cpp
int distanceToObject;
const int WHEEL_RADIUS = 53; //centimetres
```

Processes
---------

For functions and tasks, use camelCase.  
Be specific with the name of a function; describe what the function does.

```cpp
void functionThatMovesRobot() { //Drives forward.
    //Function code goes here.
}
```

is better written as

```cpp
void driveForward() {
    //Function code goes here.
}
```

Structs
-------

For struct definitions, use PascalCase.  
For instances of structs, use camelCase.

```cpp
typedef struct {
    int xValue;
    int yValue;
} CartesianCoordinates;

CartesianCoordinates pointOfIntersection;
```

Hardware
--------

Use camelCase to name all motors, sensors, and servos.  
In a tank drive configuration, name the main drive motors `motorsLeft` and 
`motorsRight`.  
In a mecanum or other custom drive configuration, name the motors 
`motorFrontLeft`, `motorFrontRight`, `motorBackLeft`, and `motorBackRight`.

```cpp
#pragma config(Hubs,  S1,  HTMotor,  HTMotor,  HTMotor,  HTServo)
#pragma config(Sensor,  S1,     ,              sensorI2CMuxController)
#pragma config(Sensor,  S2,     irSensor,      sensorI2CCustom)
#pragma config(Motor,   mtr_S1_C1_1,   motorsRight,    tmotorTetrix, encoder)
#pragma config(Motor,   mtr_S1_C1_2,   motorsLeft,     tmotorTetrix, reversed, encoder)
#pragma config(Motor,   mtr_S1_C2_1,   pulleyMotor,    tmotorTetrix)
#pragma config(Motor,   mtr_S1_C2_2,   flagMotor,      tmotorTetrix)
#pragma config(Motor,   mtr_S1_C3_1,   hangingMotor,   tmotorTetrix)
#pragma config(Motor,   mtr_S1_C3_2,   harvestMotor,   tmotorTetrix)
#pragma config(Servo,   srvo_S1_C4_1,  gun,            tServoStandard)
#pragma config(Servo,   srvo_S1_C4_2,  flagExtender,   tServoContinuousRotation)
#pragma config(Servo,   srvo_S1_C4_3,  harvestLifter,  tServoContinuousRotation)
//*!!Code automatically generated by 'ROBOTC' configuration wizard         !!*//
```

\#define
--------

No, with the exception of the following structure to ensure that a file is not 
included multiple times:

```cpp
/* DriveMotors.h */
#ifndef DRIVEMOTORS_H
#define DRIVEMOTORS_H

//Library code for driving the robot goes here.

#endif
```

As is true for `goto` statements, it is generally agreed that using macros is 
bad coding practice, regardless of how convenient they may be. If a macro would 
replace a function, define a function to do the job instead; if a macro is used 
to replace a constant, define a `const`.

```cpp
#define true false //happy debugging
```

**Happy hacking!**
