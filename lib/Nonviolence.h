Nonviolence.h
"Together, we CAN stop motor abuse."
A function to alleviate instant, jerky velocity changes in motors, instead gradually accelerating them to speed.

LastUpdatedOn: 10-29-14

Status: Major edits - modes and struct - untested.

Todo next possibly:
Generalize for anything - smoothly move from point A to point B. Maybe callbacks - LOLZ ROBOTC DOESN'T SUPPORT THEM. Maybe reference variables.
Does this integrate nicely? Is the distance consistent? Is there a way to apply this to encoder counts rather than speeds? (test it with encoders!)

/* HOW TO USE IT
Beginning of program:
	startTask(nonviolenceTask);

When moving: (instead of motor[motorsLeft] = 100;)
	nonviolence(motorsLeft, 100);//Default (NV_DEFAULT_MODE) is (at the time of this writing) NV_MODE_LINEAR.
	nonviolence(motorsLeft, 100, NV_MODE_STEP); //Steps it directly to the target speed, with total violence. Just like motor[motorsLeft] = 100;.
	nonviolence(motorsLeft, 100, NV_MODE_LINEAR); //Linearly ramps it up/down to the target speed.
	nonviolence(motorsLeft, 100, NV_MODE_LOGISTIC); //Logistically ramps it up/down to the target speed.

Note that this uses a task. The NXT is (apparently) limited to 5 tasks, so be careful of this limit!
Note also that the NXT is not actually thread-safe, even though it has multiple "threads" running "concurrently."
This also has a ton of global constants, all prefixed with NV_.
This also contains a function, and if you ever run up against the ROBOTC 256-function limit... what are you even doing?

/*
The "NV" Motor Queue
This queue will store the motors being acted upon. Doesn't do anything until you start calling nonviolence().
When you call nonviolence(), it adds a motor to that queue, with all the properties of the path it will follow. (motornumber, initial position, target, path mode)
Next time you call nonviolence(), that motor is already in the queue, so it'll just be modified.
When nonviolenceTask runs (once every NV_tick milliseconds), it will look at all the "active" motors in the queue and increment them along their journey.

Why do we need it? To support multiple motors running at once.
Also, because there is no way to access the list of motor numbers currently available, so they must be added on sight.
Mainly, because ROBOTC is really annoying.
